# [Advent of Code [2023]](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event with daily programming puzzles that cover a range of difficulty levels and problem types.

## Structure

Each day's challenges are organized in separate directories named `day_X`, where `X` represents the day. 

```bash
AdventOfCode/
│
├── day_1/
│   └── main.py
├── day_2/
│   ├── main.py
...
```

Running the Solutions
To run a solution, navigate to the specific day's directory and run the Python script for the part you're interested in. For example:

```bash
python day_1/main.py
```
